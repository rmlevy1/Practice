# Testing

This repository is for practice to learn how to edit the README from the terminal/IDE

So far these are the steps I am aware of to create a repository from the terminal like a pro!

1. echo "# Readme title" >> README.md
2. git init
3. git add README.md
4. git commit -m "first commit"
5. git push origin master
